# Boost.Http.Proto

## This is currently **NOT** an official Boost library.

## Overview

Boost.Http.Proto is a portable, low-level C++ library which provides containers
and algorithms for implementing the HTTP/1.1 protocol described in the document
[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230),
henceforth referred to as
[rfc7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230).

Boost.Http.Proto offers these features:

* Require only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, no templates
* Strict compliance with rfc7230

## Requirements

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++11
* Aliases for standard types use their Boost equivalents
* Link to a built static or dynamic Boost library, or use header-only (see below)
* Supports -fno-exceptions, detected automatically

### Header-Only

To eliminate the requirement to link a program to a static or dynamic
Boost.Http.Proto library, simply place the following line in *exactly one*
source file in your project.
```
#include <boost/http_proto/src.hpp>
```

### Embedded

Boost.HTTP.Proto works great on embedded devices.
It is designed to work without exceptions if desired.

### Supported Compilers

Boost.Http.Proto has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 3.8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* gcc: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* msvc: 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

### Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes
these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Benchmark performance comparisons
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io, Azure Pipelines, Appveyor
* Fuzzing using clang-llvm and machine learning
